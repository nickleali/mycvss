# Closing the Vulnerability Gap through CVSS Maturity

How can the vulnerability disclosure ecosystem better help our customers to make decisions about prioritization?

Should this focus on CVSS?

## The CVSS Base Score problem

CVSS has become shorthand for patch prioritization. But this overstates risk.

CVSS Threat and Environmental in the standard help. However, CVSS-BTE presents challenges and difficulty to do at scale.

Scanning vendors do not detail 

## The fractured ecosystem

Data exists in many forms from many sources. The perceived unreliability, real or imagined, respresents mistrust in primary vendors.

Scanners and other vulnerability management vendors have stepped in. 

How can we re-establish trust in primary sources? How can we help organizations manage this themselves?

## Your Vendors Aren’t Lying: They Just Don’t Know

Vulnerability assessment versus asset mismatches

## Vulnerability Databases

CVE completeness. 

## Solutions

### Improving CVE descriptions

Transparency is important. Customers will second-guess data that isn't well explained. The description forms the basis of that trust. 

More to come on this issue!

### CVSS

Vector maturity.

Show in the calculator and in documentation that an assessment is incomplete until the Threat and Environmental Scores are available.

Do we need to change the conversation about who provides these assessments.

Worst-case versus reasonable deployment.

### Synthesis of existing data

How can we bring together threat intelligence, EPSS, CISA KEV, and others in a systemic way?

Can the CVE program include that data alongside CVE?

Is NVD willing to include threat and environmenta?
